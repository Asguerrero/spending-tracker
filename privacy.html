			<h1 style="margin-top: 3rem;">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
			<p><strong>Before we get into the legalese, a message from our founder:</strong></p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">My name is Kerry and I'm the founder of My Spending Tracker. Thank you for dropping by!</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">If you're like me, you want to guard your privacy online as best you can. And you certainly don't want companies to spy on you and sell out your data to make a quick buck.</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">I started My Spending Tracker as a service for my family. We use it every day. It treats your data the same as it treats my own, with careful attention maintaining privacy.</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">So let me state my realistic privacy commitment to you as clearly as I can:</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>We seriously value your privacy.&nbsp;</strong>My Spending Tracker is a family-owned business and we respect your family and community. We do not rent, sell, share, or disclose <strong><u>any</u></strong> of your data, regardless of whether it is personally identifying, to any third parties except when required by law or when necessary for the purpose of providing, maintaining, or improving this website, the My Spending Tracker service, and related services provided by us such as customer support and new product offerings. Any data that does not need to be retained for those reasons is permanently deleted from our systems within 30 days.</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Our systems do not handle your payment information.&nbsp;</strong>We rely on <a data-action="url" data-params="false" href="clkn/https/stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, a world leader in online payment processing, to handle your payment information. When you submit payment information to our service the information goes directly to Stripe, not through our systems. We never see your credit or debit card information. So you need not worry about us losing it.</p>

			<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Like every other Internet-based service, we rely on third party services.</strong> For example, like many other companies we rely on <a data-action="url" data-params="false" href="clkn/https/aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>. We only choose third party service providers that we believe are skilled at and serious about minimizing data leaks. If we ever become aware of a third party breach affecting your data we'll let you know.</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Like every other Internet-based service, we may screw up.</strong> Computer systems are complicated and there are criminals on the Internet, so it's possible we'll make a mistake or be compromised. If that happens we'll put all hands on deck to resolve the issue as best as we can. And, again, if we ever become aware of something like this we'll let you know.</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Thank you for taking the time to read my note. I hope you give My Spending Tracker a try and tell your friends if you love it.</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Warmest regards,<br>Kerry</p>
